# Rust Scribble Game README

- only merge working code into master
- use ```cargo clippy``` to check your code
- check out ```messages.rs``` to see what messages are sent between client and server

## How to run it 

1. Run Server
    ```bash 
    cd server
    cargo run
    ```
2. Open new terminal and change directory to client. Then run  
    ```bash 
    cargo run 
    ``` 
3. For a second window to test e.g. the chat messages: repeat step 2.
